It all started during another boring college lecture in 2006. It was so boring that I spontaneously started drawing people around me, just like sketchers in American courts. Later on someone suggested trying to draw comic strips. Somehow one of the figures I had drawn seemed to be perfect fit for a main character.

And that's how Zygfryd was born. I made about 80 comic strips featuring him. I was covering my personal issues as well as politics, current events, society and so on. 

Now I'm keeping them here for nostalgic reasons.
